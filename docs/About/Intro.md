## Introduction

ODOP is:   

* OPEN   

As in Open Source Software. 
The program's source code is available to all at no cost.
For additional information on open source concepts see:

* DESIGN   

The ODOP software approaches "design" from an engineering perspective.
Specifically, this notion of design is all about selecting appropriate values 
for parameters that can be controlled in order to achieve the desired performance 
of an engineering system.
A mathematical model of the system under investigation is required.
While this is "computer aided design", computer graphics in the form of
drafted drawings or 3D models are not central to this design process.
   

* OPTIMIZATION

Once a real world system is expressed in terms of a mathematical model,
that model may be manipulated by numerical search and mathermatical optimization techniques.
The process is sometimes referred to as "goal seeking".
If a designer's goals are expressed in terms of one-sided constraints
or two-sided "FIXes", the software can search for and find a "feasible" solution, if one exists.
Once a feasible solution is known to exist, the software can seek an "optimal" solution
that provides the best solution available within the established constraints. 
   

* PLATFORM

The ODOP software consists of a problem independent core ... the "platform" on which
any number of mathematical models (a.k.a. "Design Types") can be built.
The core solution techniques (SEARCH, SEEK and TRADE) may then be applied to
those mathematical models in order to create specific designs.
Designs may be stored in a design library for later re-use.
Specific design types may offer problem-specific reports that may be saved or printed.
Specific design types may offer easy selection from tables of material properties
or the ability to select from catalogs of standard component sizes or even
catalogs of stock designs.
