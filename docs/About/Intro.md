## Introducing ODOP

**ODOP** is a web software application (web app) currently under development.
It provides a number of features and capabilities to facilitate the analysis 
and design of a broad range of problems that have a mathematical model available. 

The Rectangular Solid design type is provided as an easy to understand demonstration
of basic capabilities.
[ODOP Introduction](ODOPintro) starts with basic concepts and then leads to a
less technical Getting Started explanation based on the Rectangular Solid.

**ODOP:Spring** is a full-featured app enabling the engineering 
design of helical coil compression springs.
While certainly capable of analyzing the performance of an existing spring design,
ODOP:Spring is at its best when used to develop solutions to difficult and 
highly constrained original design problems.

[Spring design tutorial and demo](../Help/gettingStartedSpring) provides instructions
on how to launch the demo and tutorial sessions.
The spring design tutorial session named **tutorTour** is a good starting point for those
interested in the shortest possible path to designing springs.

[Launching the program](../Help/launchODOP) provides instructions on starting the program,
selecting the appropriate design type and how to arrange browser windows for the best
possible presentation.
