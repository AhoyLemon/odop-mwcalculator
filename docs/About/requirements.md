## Requirements

In theory, the only requirement to operate the ODOP software is a modern web browser.
In practice, all web browsers and all hardware platforms are not equal.
As the expression goes, "Your mileage may vary".   

While the hardware environment "responsive" nature of the ODOP software allows 
it to function on many mobile devices,
it is expected that most users doing serious design work will run the software on a
desktop computer with a relatively large and relatively high resolution monitor. 
When operating on a small screen mobile device like a cell phone, 
the various sections on the right of the main page will move downward.
