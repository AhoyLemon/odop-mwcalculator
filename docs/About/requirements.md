## Requirements

In theory, the only requirement to operate the ODOP software is a modern web browser.
In practice, all web browsers and all hardware platforms are not equal.
As the expression goes, "Your mileage may vary".   

It is expected that most users doing serious design work will run the ODOP software on a
desktop or laptop computer with a relatively large and relatively high resolution monitor. 
The hardware environment "responsive" nature of the ODOP software allows 
it to function on many mobile devices.
When operating on a small screen mobile device like a cell phone, 
the various sections on the right of the main page will automatically move downward on the page.
Thus, a mobile device user can scroll vertically to see all the content in 
a legible manner.
Unfortunately, the necessary degree of scrolling may impact productivity and 
general satisfaction with operation on that platform.

ODOP is developed using the current version Google Chrome and routinely tested 
using current versions of other browsers including Microsoft Edge.  
Depending on screen size and resolution, 
Firefox users may find it desirable to adjust font size in order to optimize the on-screen presentation.
Microsoft Internet Explorer is not supported for operation with ODOP.
