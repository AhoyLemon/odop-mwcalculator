## User Accounts, Username, Login, Logout

In order to keep saved designs private, 
it is necessary to establish a user account that provides a unique username and password.   

![Sign-in screen](../Help/png/SignInWidgetExpanded.png "Sign-in screen")    

To establish a free account, send a request to:   

**Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**   

After some delay, you will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
The process contains one step that is not automated, so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and if necessary, change it in the future.
Note that the opportunity to activate the account expires seven days after the welcome letter is issued.    
   
See [Default Designs](../Help/defaultDesigns) for information on how a private design
can be used to personalize system provided default designs.

In order to logout, use the browser refresh button and then click the "Logout" button.

Note that there is an inactivity timeout. 
After a period of inactivity (2 - 8 hours), the user will be automatically logged out. 
If that happens, un-saved data will be lost. 
An attempt to save a design after automatic logout will produce an error.
