## User Accounts, Username, Login, Logout

A user account with username and password is required to operate the software.   

Evaluators may sign-in with the username "public" and password "public".
It is possible to save designs but keep in mind that all saved information will be completely public.
Designs in the public account more than one week old are subject to being removed 
with only minimal notice on the [Message of the Day](messageOfTheDay) page.

In order to keep saved designs private and be assured of long-term storage, 
it is necessary to establish a private user account with an associated unique username and password. 
To establish a free private account, 
use the "Sign up" (Self-Service Registration) feature on the sign-in page. 
Instructions on how to complete the sign-up process will be provided promptly via email.

Alternatively, send a request to:   

**Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**   

You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
This alternative contains one step that is not automated, 
so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and if desired, 
change it in the future.
Note that the opportunity to activate the account expires seven days after the welcome letter is issued.    

An account username must be in the form of an email address. 
As noted in our [Privacy Notice](Legal/PrivacyStatement), 
your personal information will be secure and not abused. 
If you have any remaining concerns on this point, 
using an email account different than your primary email account is a reasonable approach.

The ODOP user account (username / password) feature is based on capabilities provided by 
[Okta](https://www.okta.com/).
Do not expect the ODOP:Spring app to appear on Okta's list of apps and 
do not be concerned about a "You don't have any apps." message on your personal Okta home page
(used for adding apps, changing or recovering passwords, etc.).
Once you have established a password, 
simply [launch the program](../Help/launchODOP) 
in order to get to the sign-in page.

**Screen capture of the sign-in page:**   
![Sign-in screen](../Help/png/SignInWidgetExpanded.png "Sign-in screen")    
   
See [Default Designs](../Help/defaultDesigns) for information on how a private design
can be used to personalize system provided default designs.

See [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions) for long term data storage policies in private accounts.

In order to sign out:
  - use "Logout" on the File menu
  - use the browser refresh button and then click the "Logout" button

The design intent of the user account feature has the user session expire (time-out) after a period of inactivity 
(in the future, 8 hours or longer). 
Currently, there is an issue with this feature that is under active investigation.
Until this issue is resolved, 
user sessions expire eight hours after the most recent selection of a design type, 
regardless of other activity. 
It is possible to defer session expiration for another eight hours by 
re-selecting the design-type after using the browser refresh button. 
If working an in-progress design, 
first save it (**File : Save** and **File : SaveAs** menus), 
and then after browser refresh and re-selecting the design-type, 
re-select the previously saved design.
If a session expires, 
it will not be possible to open existing designs or save in-progress designs. 
In this situation, 
it should still be possible to print from your browser to save the current details of an in-progress design. 
Recover from an expired session by using browser refresh and then re-enter username and password.
