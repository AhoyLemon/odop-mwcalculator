## User Accounts, Username, Login, Logout

In order to keep saved designs private, 
it is necessary to establish a user account that provides a unique username and password.
To establish a free account, send a request to **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**.
You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
The process contains one step that is not automated, so expect a delay of a day or more.   

The ODOP software expects to start from an existing design.  
See [Default designs](../Help/defaultDesigns) for information on how a private design
can be used to personalize system provided default designs.

In order to logout, use the browser refresh button and then click the "Logout" button.

Note that there is an inactivity timeout. 
After a period of inactivity (2 - 8 hours), the user will be automatically logged out. 
If that happens, un-saved data will be lost. 
An attempt to save a design after automatic logout will produce an error.

When invoked from the ODOP Sign-In, this page opens in a new browser tab.
Switch tabs in order to return to that Sign-In page or simply close this tab.
