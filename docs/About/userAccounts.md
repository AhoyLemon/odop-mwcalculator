## User Accounts, Login, Logout

A user account with username and password is required to access ODOP.
To establish a free account, send your request to **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**.
You will receive a reply message containing instructions on creating your account.

Once logged in, various sections of the on-line Help will provide additional information on getting started with the software.
For example, see:  
*  [Intro](intro)  
*  [ODOP Intro](ODOPintro)  
*  [Getting Started](./Help/gettingStarted)  
*  [Getting Started With the Spring Tutorial and Demo](./Help/gettingStartedSpring)  
*  [Launching the program](./Help/launchODOP)
*  [Introduction](./Help/introduction)

In particular, note that the user is expected to start from an existing design.
Each "Design Type" contains a system provided design by the name of "Startup" 
Each "Design Type" also contains one or more system provided designs marked "[ReadOnly]".

Each user will be able to save designs into a private section of the ODOP design library.

It is possible to save "on top of" a system design.

In order to logout, use the browser refresh button, click the "Logout" button.

Note that there is an inactivity timeout.  
After approximately 8 (?) hours of inactivity, the user will be automatically logged out.
Any attempt to save a design after that point will produce an error and un-saved data will be lost.
