## User Accounts, Username, Login, Logout

A user account with username and password is required to operate the software.   

Evaluators may sign-in with the username "public" and password "public".
It will be possible to save designs but keep in mind that all saved information will be completely public.
Saved designs in the public account that are more than one week old are subject to being removed 
with only minimal notice on the [Message of the Day](messageOfTheDay) page.

In order to keep saved designs private, 
it is necessary to establish a private user account with an associated unique username and password. 
To establish a free private account, 
use the "Sign up" (Self-Service Registration) feature on the sign-in page,
or send a request to:   

**Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**   

You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
This will happen promptly if using Self-Service Registration or 
after some delay with the email request alternative. 
The email request alternative contains one step that is not automated, 
so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and if desired, 
change it in the future.
Note that the opportunity to activate the account expires seven days after the welcome letter is issued.    

An email address is required for the username.
As noted in our [Privacy Notice](Legal/PrivacyStatement), 
your personal information will be secure and not abused. 
If you have any remaining concerns on this point, 
using an email account different than your primary email account is a reasonable approach.

The ODOP user account (username / password) feature is based on capabilities provided by 
[Okta](https://www.okta.com/).
Do not expect the ODOP:Spring app to appear on Okta's list of apps and 
do not be concerned about a "You don't have any apps." message on your personal Okta home page
(used for adding apps, changing or recovering passwords, etc.).
Once you have established a password, 
simply [launch the program](../Help/launchODOP) 
in order to get to the sign-in page.

**Screen capture of the sign-in page:**   
![Sign-in screen](../Help/png/SignInWidgetExpanded.png "Sign-in screen")    
   
See [Default Designs](../Help/defaultDesigns) for information on how a private design
can be used to personalize system provided default designs.

See [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions) for long term data storage policies in private accounts.

In order to sign out:
  - use "Logout" on the File menu
  - use the browser refresh button and then click the "Logout" button

Note that by design, after a period of inactivity (in the future, 8 hours or longer), 
the user session will expire. 
Currently, there is an issue with this feature that is under active investigation.
Until this issue is resolved, user sessions expire eight hours after login regardless of activity.
If that happens, it will not be possible to open (**File : Open** menu) existing designs or
save (**File : Save** and **File : SaveAs** menus) in-progress designs. 
In this situation, 
it should still be possible to print from your browser to save the current state of an in-progress design.

When invoked from the ODOP Sign-In, this page opens in a new browser tab.
Switch tabs in order to return to that Sign-In page or simply close this tab.
