## User Accounts, Username, Login, Logout

A user account with username and password is required to access ODOP.
To establish a free account, send a request to **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**.
You will receive a reply message with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
The process contains one step that is not automated, so expect a delay of a day or more.

[Intro Pages Overview](introPagesOverview) provides links to  on-line help pages that
provide important information about getting started with the software. 
In particular, note that the software expects to start from an existing design. 
Each "Design Type" contains one or more system provided designs marked "[ReadOnly]". 
For each Design Type, the system provided design by the name of "Startup" is the default starting design. 

Each user will be able to save designs into a private section of the ODOP design library. 
It is possible to save a private design "on top of" a system design of the same name. 
This feature allows the default startup design to be personalized.
Once such a private design is deleted, the underlying system design (marked "[ReadOnly]") 
will again be available.

In order to logout, use the browser refresh button and then click the "Logout" button.

Note that there is an inactivity timeout. 
After a period of 2 - 8 hours of inactivity, the user will be automatically logged out. 
If that happens, un-saved data will be lost. 
An attempt to save a design after automatic logout will produce an error.
