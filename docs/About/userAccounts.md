## User Accounts, Username, Login, Logout

In order to keep saved designs private, 
it is necessary to establish a user account with an associated unique username and password.   

**Screen capture of the sign-in page:**   
![Sign-in screen](../Help/png/SignInWidgetExpanded.png "Sign-in screen")    

To establish a free account, send a request to:   

**Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**   

After some delay, 
you will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
The process contains one step that is not automated, so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and if desired, 
change it in the future.
Note that the opportunity to activate the account expires seven days after the welcome letter is issued.    

An email address is required for the username.
As noted in our [Privacy Notice](Legal/PrivacyStatement), 
your personal information will be secure and not abused. 
If you have any remaining concerns on this point, 
using an email account different than your primary email account is a reasonable approach.

The ODOP user account (username / password) feature is based on capabilities provided by 
[Okta](https://www.okta.com/).
Do not expect the ODOP app to appear on Okta's list of apps and 
do not be concerned about a "You don't have any apps." message on your personal Okta home page
(used for adding apps, changing or recovering passwords, etc.).
Once you have established a password, 
simply [launch the program](../Help/launchODOP) 
in order to get to the sign-in page.
   
See [Default Designs](../Help/defaultDesigns) for information on how a private design
can be used to personalize system provided default designs.

In order to sign out, use the browser refresh button and then click the "Logout" button.

Note that by design, after a period of inactivity (in the future, 2 - 8 hours), 
the user will be automatically logged out. 
Currently, there is an issue with this feature that is under active investigation.
Until this issue is resolved, users are logged out one hour after login.
If that happens, un-saved data will be lost. 
An attempt to save a design after automatic logout will produce an error. 
In this situation, 
it should still be possible to print from your browser to save the current state of an in-progress design.

When invoked from the ODOP Sign-In, this page opens in a new browser tab.
Switch tabs in order to return to that Sign-In page or simply close this tab.
