## User Accounts, Username, Login, Logout

A user account with username and password is required to operate the software.   

Evaluators may sign-in with the username "public" and password "public".
It is possible to save designs but keep in mind that all saved information will be completely public.
Designs in the public account are not assured of long-term storage.
See [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions) for long-term data storage policies.

In order to keep saved designs private and be assured of long-term storage, 
it is necessary to establish a private user account with an associated unique username and password. 
To establish a free private account, 
use the "Sign up" (Self-Service Registration) feature on the sign-in page. 
After you respond to an activation email message, 
your account will be ready for immediate login.

Alternatively, send a request to: **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**. 
You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
This alternative contains one step that is not automated, 
so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and if desired, 
change it in the future.

The ODOP user account (username / password) feature is based on capabilities provided by 
[Okta](https://www.okta.com/).
Do not expect the ODOP:Spring app to appear on Okta's list of apps and 
do not be concerned about a "You don't have any apps." message on your personal Okta home page
(used for adding apps, changing or recovering passwords, etc.).
Once you have established a password, 
simply [launch the program](../Help/launchODOP) 
in order to get to the sign-in page.
It is also possible to launch the program from the SpringDesignSoftware.org home page, 
Getting Started page or any of the three spring type pages. 

An account username must be in the form of an email address. 
As noted in our [Privacy Notice](Legal/PrivacyStatement), 
your personal information will be secure and not abused. 
If you have any remaining concerns on this point, 
using an email account different than your primary email account is a reasonable approach.

**Screen capture of the sign-in page:**   
![Sign-in screen](../Help/png/SignInWidgetExpanded.png "Sign-in screen")    

See [Password reset](../Help/htt#passwordReset) for instructions on how to 
change a password or recover from a lost password after account creation is complete. 
   
See [Default Designs](../Help/defaultDesigns) for information on how a private design
can be used to personalize system provided default designs.

See [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions) for long term data storage policies 
in both public and private accounts.

In order to sign out:
  - use "Logout" on the File menu
  - use the browser refresh button and then click the "Logout" button

Once signed in, your user session will remain active for as long as the browser window (tab) 
associated with the app exists and your Internet connection is maintained. 
Actually, the user session may persist for up to two hours after loss of Internet connection or 
closing a previous browser window or tab. 
In this situation, you may be able to open a new browser window (tab) and open a previously saved design without 
need to sign-in again. 
However, you should learn to save frequently as once the browser window or tab is closed, 
any unsaved design in progress will be lost.

When invoked from the ODOP Sign-In, this page opens in a new browser tab.
Switch tabs in order to return to that Sign-In page or simply close this tab.
