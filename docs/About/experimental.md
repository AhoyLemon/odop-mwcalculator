## Experimental Software

The ODOP software is experimental and under development.
You should expect to encounter operational issues and problems of varying severity.

Specifically, multi-user support and user authentication are not yet implemented.
As a result, any user of the program will be able to see the information saved by any other user.
So, for the duration, DO NOT SAVE PRIVATE INFORMATION !

Most browser users are conditioned to use the browser refresh button as a means to recovery from various operational difficulties and anomalies. 
Unfortunately, using the browser "Refresh" function with a single page web app such as ODOP will likely result in a complete reset of the main page 
and potential loss of a user's work since the last Save operation. 
Similarly, use of the browser "Back" function followed by "Forward" will likely result in reset of the main page.
While an AutoSave feature may be implemented in a future release, this would be unlikely to happen before multi-user support.
So for the duration, 
save frequently and use the browser Refresh and Back functions with the understanding that work since your last save will likely be lost.   

Note:   
The on-line documentation pages (Help) are not subject to the same concerns about browser refresh and browser back / forward.
