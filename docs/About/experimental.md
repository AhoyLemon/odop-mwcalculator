## Experimental Software

The **O**pen **D**esign **O**ptimization **P**latform software 
and ODOP:Spring app are experimental and under development. 
Improvements are being released as frequently as one or more times per month. 
You should expect to encounter operational issues and problems of varying severity.
Be sure to review the [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions) page before committing to designs generated with this software.

Most browser users are conditioned to use the browser "Refresh" a.k.a. "Reload" button 
as a means to recovery from various operational difficulties and anomalies. 
Unfortunately, 
using the browser Reload function with a single page web app such as ODOP will likely result in a complete reset of the main page 
and potential loss of a user's work since the last Save operation. 
Similarly, use of the browser "Back" function followed by "Forward" will likely result in reset of the main page.   

Work on an AutoSave feature to partly mitigate these issues is currently in progress. 
Hopefully, this feature will be included in a near future release. 
In the mean time, 
save frequently and use the browser Reload and Back functions with the understanding that 
work since your last Save will likely be lost.   

Note:   
The On-line Help documentation pages are not subject to the same concerns about browser Reload and browser Back / Forward.
