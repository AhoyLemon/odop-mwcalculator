## Experimental Software

The ODO:P software is experimental and under development.
You should expect to encounter operational issues and problems of varying severity.

Specifically, multi-user support and user authentication will not be implemented until sometime well after release 1.0.

As a result, any user of the program (that means just about anybody!) will be able to see the information saved by any other user.
So, for the duration, DO NOT SAVE PRIVATE INFORMATION !

Most browser users are conditioned to use the browser refresh button as a means to recovery from various operational difficulties and anomalies. 
Unfortunately, using the refresh button with a single page web app such as ODO:P will almost inevitably result in a complete reset of the main page 
and potential loss of a user's work since the last Save operation. 
An AutoSave feature may (or may not) be implemented in a future release.
However this would be unlikely to happen before multi-user support.
So, for the duration, save frequently and user the browser refresh button only with the understanding that work since your last save will be lost.
