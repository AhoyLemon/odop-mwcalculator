## Experimental Software

The ODOP software is experimental and under development.
You should expect to encounter operational issues and problems of varying severity.

Specifically, multi-user support and user authentication is not implemented yet.

As a result, any user of the program will be able to see the information saved by any other user.
So, for the duration, DO NOT SAVE PRIVATE INFORMATION !

Most browser users are conditioned to use the browser refresh button as a means to recovery from various operational difficulties and anomalies. 
Unfortunately, using the refresh button with a single page web app such as ODOP will likely result in a complete reset of the main page 
and potential loss of a user's work since the last Save operation. 
An AutoSave feature may be implemented in a future release.
However, this would be unlikely to happen before multi-user support.
So, for the duration, save frequently and use the browser refresh button only with the understanding that work since your last save will likely be lost.
