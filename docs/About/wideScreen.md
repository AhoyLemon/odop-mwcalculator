#### Utilizing Help with a widescreen monitor

Where a wide screen monitor is in use, 
it should be possible to configure two independent browser sessions in a 
side-by-side configuration.
Note that this is different than two tabs in one browser session.
Put the On-line Help content in one browser window such that it
takes up roughly one third of the screen width.
Put the ODOP main page in a separate browser window such that it takes up 
the remaining two thirds of the screen width.
It will then be possible to view both the screen captures in the Getting Started 
discussion and the referenced program features on the main page at the same time.

If you are using this side-by-side  browser configuration, 
launch the ODOP program in each browser window.
In the smaller window, click the "About" link of the ODOP starting dialog
as highlighted in red of the screen capture below.   

![ODOP starting dialog](./png/StartDialog.png "ODOP starting dialog")   

That "About" link will take you to the ODOP Introduction page. 
From there you can procede to the Getting Started page and 
continue with those instructions while viewing ODOP program operation 
in the larger window.   

&nbsp;

In the larger window, select the design type and specific design that you 
wish to work with.
The screen capture below illustrates selecting the Rectangular **Solid** design type
which is used in the ODOP Introduction and Getting Started instructions. 
Select the Solid design type before continuing with those instructions.   

At a minimum, each design type is supplied with a default design by the name of "Startup".
Leave this startup design selected in order to continue with the 
ODOP Introduction and Getting Started instructions.

The resulting configuration of two browser sessions on a wide-screen monitor 
should look something like:

To continue, use your browser's **Back** button to return to the previous page now.
