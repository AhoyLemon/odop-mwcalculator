ODOP version 3.4 was released April 19, 2020. 
Opening a design saved in a prior version will produce a pop-up message of the form:
"Migrated design from version {_previous version number_} to {_current version number_}. 
Saving the design will eliminate the pop-up message until release of a future ODOP version impacting the design model.
Complete detail on the latest changes is available in GitHub at: 
[ODOP milestone 3.4](https://github.com/thegrumpys/odop/milestone/34?closed=1)

ODOP is experimental software.
