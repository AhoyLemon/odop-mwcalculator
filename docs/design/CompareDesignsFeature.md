## Idea for a Compare Designs feature

The PL/I program provided a rudimentary ability to compare results before and after certain changes.
Refer to the "Before Search" column provided by some of the LIST sub-commands.
Some of the associated demo and tutorial sections took advantage of this capability in order to better describe what happened.

It would be desirable to have a comparable feature in the web app.
Specifically, it is desirable to have a single screen comparison display for results 
before and after a Search, Seek or Trade operation.
Ideally, it would be also be possible to compare two different designs from the design library.
