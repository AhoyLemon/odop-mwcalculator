## AutoSave feature

Most browser users are conditioned to use the browser refresh button as a means to recovery from various operational difficulties and anomalies.  
Unfortunately, using the refresh button with a single page web app such as ODO:P will result in a complete reset of the main page 
and potential loss of a user's work since the last Save operation.

An "AutoSave" feature could work to mitigate the potential loss of work. 
Different triggers for AutoSave events are possible.   
For example:   
* After a fixed quantity of time; perhaps user adjustable in preferences 
* After every use of Search, Seek or Trade

It may be possible to keep a set of AutoSave points marked with a time/date stamp.
The user might be able to contol how many entries in the set.
The stack of AutoSaves could be reset every time that the user does a manual Save (SaveAs?) operration.

Note that an AutoSave feature likely should wait until after multi-user support is implemented.
