#### Procedure to implement new design types 

This entry is a placeholder for documentation on how to implement a new ODOP design type (previously "design problem").

* build a new GitHub repository ?
* plug-ins ?
*  
* Using an existing initialState.js file as an example, modify it to reflect the variables of the new design type.
* Using an existing eqnset.js file as an example, replace equations with the design equations of the new design type.
* Using an existing load.sql file as an example, overwrite the initialState section with the new initial state. 
*   
* Stuff it into the database ?
* Test.
