#### Getting Started   

Work in progress !

**GETTING_STARTED**   
 Getting started with any computer program, ODOP:Spring included, is simply a
 matter of ...  Try it.  You'll like it !   Dive in and bash away at the
 program.  It's not possible to break anything and a little experimentation
 usually goes a long way.  In the worst case, you'll come away from the
 experience with a little more motivation to read more of the on-line documentation.

**USING HELP**   

 A good place to go from here is to try HELP INTRO.  After that, perhaps
 HELP TERMINOLOGY.


**USING THE TUTORIAL AND DEMO FACILITY**   

 The tutorial is designed to introduce new users to ODOP:Spring commands and
 concepts.  It is recommended for new users as the most effective and
 organized way of learning the program.  


Start from an existing design.
The remainder of this discussion will use examples from
the compression spring design type.

CHANGE independent variables.
For the compression spring design type, those include
  WIRE_DIA, OD_FREE, COILS_T, L_FREE, FORCE_1, or FORCE_2.
 Observe the results.
 
 Look at Reports.
 
 
 Try the SEARCH command to see if it can find a "feasible" solution that
 does not violate any constraints. 
 Use the CHANGE command to establish
 constraint levels; for example,  OD\_Free MAX and/or L\_Solid MAX. 
 Repeat the  search and observe how the design is adjusted to accommodate your
 objectives.  To observe how SpringSys reacts to a request to achieve the
 impossible, increase FORCE_2 MIN until SEARCH can no longer find a feasible
 solution.  Move a different constraint, perhaps OD_FREE MAX or another
 constraint that shows up as violated, until SEARCH finds a feasible
 solution again.
 
 Use the FIX command on one or more dependent variables like RATE, L_1 or
 L_2.  Remember that a SEARCH must be performed to establish the desired
 values when you FIX a dependent variable.

 Finally, try to design a spring.  
 Use the main page entry fields to enter constraints
 associated with a hypothesized design.  Try designing the spring in a ball
 point pen, or perhaps a suspension spring for an automobile or a diesel
 locomotive.  Use the File : SAVE menu item to save the results of your work in 
 the design library.
 
 You can master the advanced features like SEEK and TRADE with the same technique. 
 Dive in and try it. 
 Also,  detailed example sessions using SEEK and TRADE are contained in the later
 sections of the tutorial.
 
 If you have already saved any work that you wish to keep, you can exit the program by
 simply closing the browser tab.
