## Design Types

See [Terminology](../terminology) for more detail on ODOP usage of the term "Design Types".   

See [Spring Design Topics](../SpringDesign) for more detail on spring design with ODOP.   
&nbsp;

Currently available Design Types include three full-featured apps for the design of
helical coil springs.
These are:   

* [Compression Spring](c_spring)   
* [Extension Spring](e_spring)   
* [Torsion Spring](t_spring)   

&nbsp;

Two relatively simple demonstration cases are also available.
These are:   

* [Rectangular Solid](r_solid)   
* [Piston-Cylinder](pcyl)
