## Design Types

See [Terminology](/docs/Help/terminology.html) for more detail on ODOP usage of the term "Design Types".   

Currently available Design Types include full-featured apps for the design of
helical coil springs.
These are:   

* [Compression Spring](c_spring.html)   
* [Extension Spring](e_spring.html)   
* [Torsion Spring](t_spring.html)   
&nbsp;

See [Spring Design Topics](/docs/Help/SpringDesign) for more detail on spring design with ODOP.   

&nbsp;

Two relatively simple demonstration cases are also available.
These are:   

* [Rectangular Solid](r_solid.html)   
* [Piston-Cylinder](pcyl.html)
