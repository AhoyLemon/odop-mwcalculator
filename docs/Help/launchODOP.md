## Launching the program   

While it is possible to use the ODOP software from a mobile device,
establishing initial impressions with a full size monitor, keyboard and mouse
is recommended.   

Where a wide screen monitor is in use, 
it should be possible to view both the program and on-line Help entries 
simultaneously in separate windows.
See: [Utilizing Help with a widescreen monitor](wideScreen) for additional details.

If a wide screen monitor is not available, 
you can operate with this Help content in one
browser tab while the ODOP main page is in another browser tab.
This approach will permit rapid switching from this Help content in order
to view the corresponding part of the program user interface
(ODOP main page).

In order to start the ODOP software, 
follow this link:

and paste it into the address field of a different browser window.
