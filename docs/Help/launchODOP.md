## Launching the program   

While it is possible to use the ODOP software from a mobile device,
establishing initial impressions with a full size monitor, keyboard and mouse
is recommended.   

Where a wide screen monitor is in use, 
it should be possible to configure two independent browser sessions in a 
side-by-side configuration.
Note that this is different than two tabs in one browser session.
Put this Help content in one browser window such that it
takes up roughly one third of the screen width.
Put the ODOP main page in a separate browser window such that it takes up 
the remaining two thirds of the screen width.
It will then be possible to see both the screen captures in the Getting Started 
discussion and the referenced program features on the main page at the same time.

Alternatively, if a wide screen monitor is not available, 
you can operate with this Help content in one
browser tab while the ODOP main page is in another browser tab.
This approach will permit rapid switching from this Help content in order
to view the corresponding part of the program user interface
(ODOP main page).

In order to start the ODOP software, 
copy this address (URL):   

**https://odop.herokuapp.com**

and paste it into the address field of your browser.   
 
If you are using the side-by-side  browser configuration, paste the URL into 
the address line of each browser.
In each browser, follow the link to bring up the ODOP starting dialog.
In the smaller window, click the "About" link.

That "About" link will take you to the ODOP Introduction page. 
From there you can procede to the Getting Started page and 
continue with those instructions while viewing ODOP program operation 
in the larger window.   

&nbsp;

In the larger window, select the design type and specific design that you 
wish to work with.
The screen capture below illustrates selecting the Rectangular **Solid** design type
which is used in the ODOP Introduction and Getting Started instructions. 
Select the Solid design type before continuing with those instructions.   

At a minimum, each design type is supplied with a default design by the name of "Startup".
Leave this startup design selected in order to continue with the 
ODOP Introduction and Getting Started instructions.

&nbsp;

The resulting configuration of two browser sessions on a wide-screen monitor 
should look something like:

To continue, use your browser's **Back** button to return to the previous page now.
