## Default designs

The ODOP software expects to start from an existing design. 
Each "Design Type" contains one or more system provided designs marked "[ReadOnly]". 
For each Design Type, the system provided design with the name "Startup" is the default starting design. 

When saving designs into a private section of the ODOP design library, 
it is possible to save a private design "on top of" a system design of the same name. 
This feature allows the default startup design to be personalized.
Once such a private design is deleted, the underlying system design (marked "[ReadOnly]") 
will again be available.
