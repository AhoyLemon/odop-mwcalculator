#### Tutorial and Demo

The ODOP tutorial / demo feature is intended to to help new users 
get started quickly.
Specially constructed tutorial and demonstration "sessions" provide multiple pages, 
where each page consists of a few paragraphs of text positioned
above the normal ODOP page.
The sessions provide input values and control of ODOP solution functions 
such that the software operates as though it was responding to user input.
Thus, the user can step through the annotated design sessions at a desired pace 
simply by reading and clicking the "Next" button.
While not technically a record / playback situation, the tutorial and demo
feature can be thought of as playing back pre-recorded design sessions.
In fact, the underlying software is always "live" and will respond to user input
in addition to responding to input from the tutorial / demo session.

A "Back" button is provided so that the user can step to previous pages in order 
to re-read or refer to something that may have been missed on the first pass.

Tutorial sessions teach operation of the program.
Use the <b>Help : Tutorial...</b> menu item to select the desired tutorial session.

Demo sessions illustrate problem solving techniques as well as provide
sample solutions to several generally available reference book problems.
Use the <b>Help : Demo...</b> menu item to select the desired demo session.

The tutorial and demo sessions need to start from a known state.
So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
use the <b>File : Save</b> or <b>File : Save As</b>
menu item to save your work before starting a session.

Topics covered (or planned) in the various sections of the tutorial include:

 tutor  - variable names, CHANGE of independent variables; analysis concept,   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FIX of dependent variables, SEARCH; equation inversion concept   
 tutor3 - constraints, constraint levels; synthesis concept   
 tutor4 - SAVE, print description of a finished design   
 tutor5 - Calculation Inputs, material properties, allowable stresses, end types   
 tutor6 - standard size table, catalog look-up   
 tutor7 - SEEK, minimize spring material; optimization concept   
 tutor8 - SEEK, exploration of available solutions   
 tutor9 - TRADE, restructuring goals to find feasible solution   

 A sequence of solved demonstration problems is available (or planned) 
 under the names demo through demo(n). 
 Many of the demo sessions contain sample solutions to selected 
 reference book problems where the ODOP:Spring results are compared to 
 the reference book results in order to validate results from the program.
