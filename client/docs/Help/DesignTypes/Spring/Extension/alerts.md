# Extension Spring Alerts &nbsp; 

Alerts specific to extension springs. 

### On this page:   
 - [Force_1 < Initial_Tension](alerts.html#F1_LT_IT)  
 - [Stress_Initial < Stress_Init_Lo](alerts.html#SInit_LT_SInit_Lo)  
 - [Stress_Initial > Stress_Init_Hi](alerts.html#SInit_GT_SInit_Hi)

## Force_1 < Initial_Tension 
In an extension spring, 
having the current value of Force_1 less than the current value of Initial_Tension 
is ambiguous.
Calculations for L_Stroke and Cycle_Life may not be valid. 

Where practical, change these values in the direction specified: 
Increase | &nbsp; | Decrease  
---      | ---    | ---  
 Force_1 | &nbsp; | Initial_Tension  
 OD_Free | &nbsp; | &nbsp;  

Alternatively, confirm that the Force_1 MIN constraint is set to the (FDCL) of Initial_Tension 
and use the Search feature (menu Action : Search or Search button).

## Stress_Initial < Stress_Init_Lo 
Initial tension in an extension spring is limited by a number of factors. 
Beyond things like the material selection and heat treatment, 
the primary factors are spring index and the torsional stress caused by initial tension.

The software calculates the dependent variables Stress_Init_Lo and Stress_Init_Hi to form a range of attainable stress. 
These values are  then applied as MIN and MAX constraints to Stress_Initial. 
The manufacture of springs with Stress_Initial less than Stress_Init_Lo is said to be "Difficult to control". 
The manufacture of springs with Stress_Initial greater than Stress_Init_Hi is said to be "Difficult to attain". 

The Calculation input SI_Range provides user control over the default constraints on Stress_Initial. 

This alert indicates that the current value of stress generated by initial tension is below the lower limit 
indicated by Stress_Init_Lo. Increasing the value of Initial_Tension should clear the alert. 

Also, if the Stress_Init_Lo and Stress_Init_Hi constraints are in place, 
the Search feature will work to generate designs that fall within the preferred range of Initial_Tension.

Initial tension in an extension spring is limited by a number of factors.

the primary factors are spring index and the torsional stress caused by initial tension.

The software calculates the dependent variables Stress_Init_Lo and Stress_Init_Hi to form a range of attainable stress.

The manufacture of springs with Stress_Initial greater than Stress_Init_Hi is said to be "Difficult to attain". 

The Calculation input SI_Range provides user control over the default constraints on Stress_Initial. 

This alert indicates that the current value of stress generated by initial tension is above the upper limit 
indicated by Stress_Init_Hi. Decreasing the value of Initial_Tension should clear the alert. 

Also, if the Stress_Init_Lo and Stress_Init_Hi constraints are in place, 
the Search feature will work to generate designs that fall within the preferred range of Initial_Tension.
