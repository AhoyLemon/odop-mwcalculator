___

## Force_1 >= Force_2 
The force at operating point 1 (Force_1) is greater than or equal to the force at operating point 2 (Force_2). 

Extension spring forces are ordered from the smallest (free condition) to Force_1 to Force_2 to the largest (Max Safe). 
The [Extension Spring Force - Deflection Diagram](/docs/Help/DesignTypes/Spring/Extension/description.html#e_springFD_Diag) 
provides more detail on this point. 

Resolve this alert by reducing the value of Force_1 below the value of Force_2. 
It should also be possible to 
confirm that Force_1 is in Free status, 
confirm that the constraint L_Stroke MIN is enabled with a non-zero constraint level 
and then use the Search feature (menu Action : Search or Search button).

___

## Force_1 < Initial_Tension 
In an extension spring, 
having the current value of Force_1 less than the current value of Initial_Tension 
is ambiguous.
Calculations for L_Stroke and Cycle_Life may not be valid. 

Where practical, change these values in the direction specified: 
Increase | &nbsp; | Decrease  
---      | ---    | ---  
 Force_1 | &nbsp; | Initial_Tension  
 OD_Free | &nbsp; | &nbsp;  

Alternatively, confirm that the Force_1 MIN constraint is set to the (FDCL) of Initial_Tension 
and use the Search feature (menu Action : Search or Search button).

<a id="SInit_LT_SInit_Lo"></a>  
___

## Stress_Initial < Stress_Init_Lo 
Initial tension in an extension spring is limited by a number of factors. 
Beyond things like the material selection and heat treatment, 
the primary factors are spring index and the torsional stress caused by initial tension.

The software calculates the dependent variables Stress_Init_Lo and Stress_Init_Hi to form a range of attainable stress. 
These values are  then applied as MIN and MAX constraints to Stress_Initial. 
The manufacture of springs with Stress_Initial less than Stress_Init_Lo is said to be "Difficult to control". 
The manufacture of springs with Stress_Initial greater than Stress_Init_Hi is said to be "Difficult to attain". 

The Calculation input SI_Range provides user control over the default constraints on Stress_Initial. 

This alert indicates that the current value of stress generated by initial tension is below the lower limit 
indicated by Stress_Init_Lo. Increasing the value of Initial_Tension should clear the alert. 

Also, if the Stress_Init_Lo and Stress_Init_Hi constraints are in place, 
the Search feature will work to generate designs that fall within the preferred range of Initial_Tension.

## Stress_Initial > Stress_Init_Hi 
Initial tension in an extension spring is limited by a number of factors. 
Beyond things like the material selection and heat treatment, 
the primary factors are spring index and the torsional stress caused by initial tension.

The software calculates the dependent variables Stress_Init_Lo and Stress_Init_Hi to form a range of attainable stress. 
These values are then applied as MIN and MAX constraints to Stress_Initial. 
The manufacture of springs with Stress_Initial less than Stress_Init_Lo is said to be "Difficult to control". 
The manufacture of springs with Stress_Initial greater than Stress_Init_Hi is said to be "Difficult to attain". 

The Calculation input SI_Range provides user control over the default constraints on Stress_Initial. 

This alert indicates that the current value of stress generated by initial tension is above the upper limit 
indicated by Stress_Init_Hi. Decreasing the value of Initial_Tension should clear the alert. 

Also, if the Stress_Init_Lo and Stress_Init_Hi constraints are in place, 
the Search feature will work to generate designs that fall within the preferred range of Initial_Tension.

<a id="FatigueInHook"></a>  
___

## Fatigue failure at end is possible 
Given the selected end type, 

bending stress in the hook at "point A" (Stress_Hook) exceeds the allowable bending stress (Stress_Lim_Bend) 

and / or 

torsional stress in the hook at "point B"  exceeds the allowable stress for the selected endurance (Stress_Lim_Endur).  

In order to clear this alert,
where practical, change one or more of these values in the direction specified. 
Increase  | &nbsp; | Decrease  
---       | ---    | ---  
 Wire_Dia | &nbsp; | Coil_Dia  
 FS_2     | &nbsp; | Force_2  
 FS_Hook  | &nbsp; | L_Stroke  
 &nbsp;   | &nbsp; | Spring_Index  

Alternatively, use Advanced View to enable the minimum constraint on FS_Hook with a constraint level of 1.0 or greater, 
enable the maximum constraint on Stress_Hook (defaults to the FDCL of Stress_Lim_Bend) 
and then use the Search feature (menu Action : Search or Search button). 
It will likely be necessary to clear some or most seemingly unrelated constraint violations in order to achieve 
no violation on the FS_Hook constraint (and thus achieve a design considered to be feasible).

<a id="PC_Safe_Deflect1_LT_20"></a>  
___

## %_Safe_Deflect @ 1 < 20% 
The first operating point (point 1) has less than 20% of maximum safe deflection. 
This is not usually a problem. 
However, you should be aware that end effects and other factors may cause some inaccuracy in forces and deflections for this point.  

Helical coil compression, extension and torsion springs that have the properties of uniform pitch and cylindrical shape 
follow Hooke's Law in that they provide a nominally linear relationship between force and deflection. 
Howevever, in the real world there are limitations. 

When extension springs are extended less than roughly 20% of safe deflection 
various factors such as deviation from perfect coil straightness (cylindric form) and 
any lack of perfect form in the ends will become a factor in the real (as opposed to theoretical) force-deflection relationship. 
Thus when operating within the first 20% of the available deflection expect forces to be somewhat lower (or deflections to be somewhat greater)
than the linear behavior predicted by the equations.
