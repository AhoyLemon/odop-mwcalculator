## %_Safe_Deflect @ 2 > 80% 
The second operating point (point 2) has more than 80% of maximum safe deflection. 
This is not usually a problem. 
However, you should be aware that Coil to coil contact may cause some inaccuracy in moments and deflections for this point.  

Helical coil compression, extension and torsion springs that have the properties of uniform pitch and cylindrical shape 
follow Hooke's Law in that they provide a nominally linear relationship between force and deflection. 
Howevever, in the real world there are limitations. 

When torsion springs are compressed beyond roughly 80% of safe deflection 
any lack of perfect uniformity in coil pitch will become a factor in the real 
(as opposed to theoretical) force-deflection relationship. 
Coil to coil contact will produce an increase in spring rate that continues to increase 
with additional deflection until the maximum safe operating condition is reached. 
Thus when operating beyond 80% of the safe deflection expect forces to be somewhat higher 
(or deflections to be somewhat lower) 
than the linear behavior predicted by the equations.

## %_Safe_Deflect @ 1 < 20% 

The first operating point (point 1) has less than 20% of maximum safe deflection. 
This is not usually a problem. 
However, you should be aware that end effects may cause some inaccuracy in moments and deflections for this point.  

Helical coil compression, extension and torsion springs that have the properties of uniform pitch and cylindrical shape 
follow Hooke's Law in that they provide a nominally linear relationship between force and deflection. 
Howevever, in the real world there are limitations. 

When torsion springs are deflected less than roughly 20% of maximum safe deflection 
deflection in the ends will become a factor in the real (as opposed to theoretical) force-deflection relationship. 
Thus when operating within the first 20% of the available deflection expect moments to be somewhat lower 
(or deflections to be somewhat greater) than the linear behavior predicted by the equations.
