# Help Lookup   

ODOP provides a full-text index of its on-line Help.   

Enter a word or phrase into the "Help lookup" text entry box at the top of the main page. 
Press the Enter key or select the magnifiying glass icon to produce a ranked list of 
on-line Help topics that contain the target word or phrase. 
If possible, each entry in the list provides a brief block of text providing a bit of context 
for how the terms are used in the Help topic. 
Select the blue topic link to open a new browser tab containing that on-line Help entry.

## Improving Help Lookup results 
Adding control characters to lookup terms can guide the lookup to better results. 

### Include multiple words with a + prefix 
For example: +feasibility +status +indicator   

### Exclude words with a - prefix 
For example: +feasibility +status +indicator -overview   

### Use * as a wildcard character 
For example: tors*   

### Restrict term matching to the topic title 
For example: title:demo   

Notes:   
By default, "fuzzy" matching is enabled to the level of one character. 
Adding, removing, changing or transposing a character in the word is considered a match.   

Adding quotes and operators like AND & OR will not produce the desired results. 
To lookup a phrase, put a + at the front of each word.
