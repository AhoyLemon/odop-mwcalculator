# Help Lookup   

ODOP provides full-text indexing of its on-line Help.    

Enter a word or phrase into the "Help lookup" text entry box at the top of the main page. 
Press the Enter key or select the magnifiying glass icon to produce a ranked listing of 
on-line Help topics that contain the target word or phrase. 
If available, each entry in the list provides a brief block of text providing a bit of context 
for how the subject word or phrase is used in the Help topic. 
Select the blue topic link to open a new browser tab containing that on-line Help entry.

ToDo:
